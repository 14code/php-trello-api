PHP Trello API v1 client
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cdaguerre/php-trello-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cdaguerre/php-trello-api)

A simple Object Oriented wrapper for the Trello API, written in PHP5.

Uses [Trello API v1](https://trello.com/docs/index.html). The object API is very similar to the RESTful API.

## Features

* Follows PSR-0 conventions and coding standards: autoload friendly
* Light and fast thanks to lazy loading of API classes
* Extensively tested

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.3.2 with [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) extension,
* [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) library,
* (optional) [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) to run tests.

## Autoload

The first step to use `php-trello-api` is to download composer:

```bash
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Then we have to install our dependencies using:
```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```
Now we can use autoloader from Composer by:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "cdaguerre/php-trello-api": "@dev"
    }
}
```

> `php-trello-api` follows the PSR-0 convention names for its classes, which means you can easily integrate `php-trello-api` classes loading in your own autoloader.

## Basic usage of `php-trello-api` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \Trello\Client();
$boards = $client->api('member')->boards()->all();
```

The `$client` object gives you access to the entire Trello API.
